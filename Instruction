2. In a specific high school, students have to swipe their IDs when they come to class in order to take
attendance.
The ID numbers are converted to names and then stored. If a student swipes more than
once in a day, the system only stores their name once.
At the end of the day, the teachers check the
results to see who came to class and who didnâ€™t.
Design a system to keep track of attendance.
Note that the machine that helps people swipe to take attendance takes ID numbers as its input.
