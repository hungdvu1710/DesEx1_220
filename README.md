Doing #2 design problem
This problem requires me to check student attendance, or in other words, to check whether they swiped in or not. The swipe machine
takes student ID as input and it indicates whether the owner of that ID checked in or not. Thus, I create a student class with only
2 basic information: name and ID. Then I create Attendance class to check student attendance and create reset() method, so that the
teacher can reset the attendance list at the end of the day. Moreover, by using Set ADT, I can make sure that no matter how many 
times the student swipe his ID, nothing will be broken.
